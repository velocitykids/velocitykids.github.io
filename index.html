                  <li>ScriptCraft - A free plugin for CraftBukkit which is what allows your child to use JavaScript within the game to create new structures and run JS files. Check it out <a href="http://scriptcraftjs.org/" target="_blank">HERE</a></li>
                  <li>If you choose to use ScriptCraft at home, be aware that you will have to run Minecraft version 1.6.4 or you will get an error and Minecraft won't load. To avoid this: Open Minecraft. On the left side of the main screen (before you click the big play button at the bottom) there is an Edit Profile button. Click Edit Profile, and then look near the middle for "Use version.” Change the version to "release 1.6.4" and then click “Save Profile.” Afterwards, you can start the game.</li>

              <h2>Feeling Adventurous?</h2>
                <h3>Here are a few additional challenges</h3>
                <p><strong>Download and Modify the Source Code:</strong> One of the main resources that we have used throughout this class is ScriptCraft, which was built by a gentleman named Walter Higgins. If you want to extend the learning that we have provided during this course, we would recommend that you start by looking at the source code for this plugin. Walter has made all of the code that goes into ScriptCraft completely open source and you and your child can download and modify his code as much as you want. We would highly recommend that you check out his GitHub repository for ScriptCraft <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Create your own mod in ScriptCraft:</strong> We would also recommend that you check out Walter Higgins' resource for creating Minecraft Mods through ScriptCraft. We will be focusing on this concept in our next Velocity class (starting TBD), but if you are interested in getting familiar with this concept, take a look at his resources. He does a great job of breaking down all of the necessary parts of a Minecraft Mod within his software and gets you started on creating and modifying mods on your own. You can find his Anatomy of a ScriptCraft Plugin <a href="https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/blob/master/docs/Anatomy-of-a-Plugin.md" target"_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
